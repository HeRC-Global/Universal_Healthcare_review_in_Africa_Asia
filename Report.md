# The Path to Universal Health Coverage in Five African and Asian Countries

## Introduction

Universal Health Coverage (UHC) is a central global health goal aimed at ensuring that allpeople have access to essential health services without suffering financial hardship. This paper examines the pathways toward UHC in five countries across Africa and Asia, highlighting how historical, political and economic contexts shape national health systems. The study emphasizes that progress toward UHC is not linear and depends on policy choices, health financing arrangements and governance structures.

## Methodology

The study employs a comparative case study design, analyzing secondary data from national health accounts, household surveys and policy documents. Key indicators examined include service coverage, financial risk protection and out-of-pocket expenditure. The authors compare health system reforms across the five countries to identify common patterns, country-specific strategies and system-level challenges influencing progress toward UHC.

## Key Findings

- Countries followed different pathways to UHC based on:
o Political will
o Institutional capacity
o Economic growth
Expansion of public health financing improved access to services.
- Risk pooling mechanisms reduced financial barriers for some populations.
- Persistent challenges included:
o High out-of-pocket payments
o Inequities in access
o Exclusion of informal sector populations
- Strong governance and consistent policies supported better UHC progress.

### Implications

- Achieving UHC requires context-specific strategies, not a one-size-fits-all model.
- Reducing direct household payments is critical for financial protection.
- Strengthening primary health care improves equity and service delivery.
- Integration of health financing with social protection systems enhances coverage.

### Call to Action

- Governments should:
- Increase public investment in health
- Expand prepayment and pooling mechanisms
- Prioritize equity-focused policies
- Strengthen health system governance and accountability.
- Invest in monitoring and evaluation to track UHC progress.

### Future of Research

- Assess long-term impacts of UHC reforms on equity and quality of care.
- Study strategies to include informal and vulnerable populations.
- Explore the role of political economy in sustaining UHC reforms.
- Examine how health system resilience affects progress toward UHC.
